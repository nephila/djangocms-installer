Preliminary checks and system libraries
---------------------------------------

While this wizard try to handle most of the things for you, it doesn't check for
all the proper native (non python) libraries to be installed.
Before running this, please check you have the proper header and libraries
installed and available for packages to be installed.

Libraries you would want to check:

* libjpeg (for JPEG support in ``Pillow``)
* zlib (for PNG support in ``Pillow``)
* postgresql (for ``psycopg2``)
* libmysqlclient (for ``Mysql``)
* python-dev (for compilation and linking)

For additional information, check https://djangocms-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/libraries.html

See `version 0.9`_ for older Django / django CMS versions support

Any beta and develop version of Django and django CMS, by its very nature,
it's not supported, while it still may work.

``djangocms-installer`` tries to support beta versions of django CMS when they
are be considered sufficiently stable by the upstream project.

Warning
-------

``djangocms-installer`` assumes that ``django-admin.py`` is installed in the same directory
as python executable, which is the standard virtualenv layout. Other installation layouts
might work, but are not officially supported.


pipenv support
--------------

A limited / experimental support to ``pipenv`` is provided.

Check documentation https://djangocms-installer.readthedocs.io/en/latest/usage.html#pipenv-support

Windows support
---------------

The installer is tested on Windows 7 with Python versions 3.4.2 and 2.7.8 installed using
official MSI packages available at http://python.org.

Please check that the ``.py`` extension is associated correctly with Python interpreter::

    c:\> assoc .py
    .py=Python.File

    c:\>ftype Python.File
    Python.File="C:\Windows\py.exe" "%1" %*
