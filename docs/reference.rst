Arguments reference
===================

Required arguments
------------------

You must always provide the following argument when invoking **djangocms installer**:

* ``project_name``: Name of the project to be created

Optionally you can provide a project directory, otherwise a directory named after the project name
will be created in the current directory.

.. warning:: project directory dir is the main project directory (the one where ``manage.py``
             will be created); by default the installer check if it's empty (minus hidden files)
             to ensure that you're running in a clean environment. If you want to use a
             non-empty directory use the ``-s`` flag;



Wizard arguments
----------------

The following arguments can be overridden in :ref:`wizard_mode`

* ``--db``, ``-d``: Database configuration (in URL format); use `dj-database-url`_
  syntax;  default: ``sqlite://localhost/project.db``

  been dropped upstream;
* ``--permissions``: Activate CMS permission management; choices: ``yes|no``, default: ``no``
* ``--languages``, ``-l``: Languages available for the project. Option can be provided multiple
  times, or as a comma separated list.

  refer to `django source`_ for a list of supported codes.
* ``--django-version``: Django version;  choices: ``1.8|1.9|1.10|1.11|stable|lts``, default: ``stable```
* ``--cms-version``, ``-v``: django CMS version, choices: ``3.4|3.5|stable|lts``.
  default: ``stable``

  after installation, choices: ``yes|no``, default: ``no``
* ``--templates``: Use a custom directory as template source; is checked to be a valid path,
  otherwise the shipped templates are used

.. note:: Django ``stable`` keyword is expanded to latest released Django version supported by django CMS
.. note:: Django ``lts`` keyword is expanded to latest released Django LTS supported by django CMS
.. note:: django-cms ``stable`` keyword is expanded to latest released django-cms version
.. note:: django-cms ``lts`` keyword is expanded to latest released django-cms LTS version
.. warning:: if an unsupported combination of Django and django CMS version is selected, the
             wizard exits reporting the error.

  and can't be disabled;
* ``--config-file``: Provides the configuration options via a ini file; see :ref:`ini_mode`;
* ``--config-dump``: Dumps the configuration in a format suitable for ``-config-file``
  option; see :ref:`ini_mode`;
